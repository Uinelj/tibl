## Why tibl ? Jekyll is nice you know

It's always fun to roll your own projet and use it daily. I like the idea of static site generators, but I dislike the fact that you often have to install numerous things on your computer to generate new versions of your site.

## The code is fugly

Yes, and it doesn't use any fancy javascript things like components, webpack or whatever.
I may add some things if the project doesn't die soon.

## What's next ?

I'm thinking of a "novel" way to post things on the internet, using long posts that aren't "oneshot" writeups, but collections of impressions throughout months or years.
We always have more than one project/idea in our mind, so i find more logical to feed multiple topics with periodical updates, rather than having multiple blog posts that are intertwined.

[tibl](https://ujj.space/tibl) is a tiny blog/site engine written in js that runs client-side.

It has been created with GitHub Pages in mind, but it should work on GitLab Pages / any server thing that can serve http just right.

There's a command-line interface named [tibl-cli](https://ujj.space/tibl/t?p=tibl-cli) that you can use to make things easier if you want.
